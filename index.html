        One day, king Akbar asked a question in his court that left everyone in
        the courtroom puzzled. As they all tried to figure out the answer,
        Birbal walked in and asked what the matter was. They repeated the
        question to him. The question was, “How many crows are there in the
        city?” Birbal immediately smiled and went up to Akbar. He announced the
        answer; he said there were twenty-one thousand, five hundred and
        twenty-three crows in the city. When asked how he knew the answer,
        Birbal replied, “Ask your men to count the number of crows. If there are
        more, then the relatives of the crows must be visiting them from nearby
        cities. If there are fewer, then the crows from our city must be
        visiting their relatives who live outside the city.” Pleased with the
        answer, Akbar presented Birbal with a ruby and pearl chain.

      <blockquote>
        Moral of the story: Having an explanation for your answer is just as
        important as having an answer.
